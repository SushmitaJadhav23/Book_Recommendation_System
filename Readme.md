<h1>Hybrid Recommender System</h1>

Goal: Design and Develop Full stack Data Science pipeline to build a Recommender system 

Technologies used:
<b> AWS S3, AWS CLI, psql, AWS RDS PostgreSQL, Python, Tableau, Collaborative Filtering, Association Rule Learning ( APRIORI ALGORITHM), Git Version Control</b>

Use case: For an online marketplace, the main problem is to increase sales of books and enhance User Experience. One approach to solve this problem is by providing personalized recommendation & improve user experience. This will help users to choose their preferred book from a vast catalog. 
It is very essential to understand user's book reading behavior, before proceeding to provide recommendation.

Dataset used: 
Book crossing is a sharing platform where users from around the globe can share books with strangers as well as track their books.
In this dataset, information about books and user rating is provided but Book purchase information is not available so I am assuming that the users who have rated the book may have purchased that book. <br>
This dataset is made available by University of Freiburg at http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/

Note: In this project; User, Customer, Consumer is used interchangeably.
